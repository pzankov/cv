\section{Experience}

\cventry{2014--present}{Software engineer}{Dependable Systems Lab, EPFL}{Lausanne, Switzerland}{}
{
  Improved the document protection endpoint agent:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item developed a userspace-kernel data serialization framework
      \item improved the labelling of protected applications
      \item automated builds and testing with Jenkins
    \end{itemize}
  Improved the S\textsuperscript{2}E-based malware scanning engine:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item eliminated false positive analysis results
      \item improved user interface by using the Kibana data visualiser
      \item extended engine to support Microsoft Office documents
      \item implemented integration with Microsoft Sharepoint
    \end{itemize}
  Integrated the S\textsuperscript{2}E symbolic execution engine with a fuzzer:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item implemented both S\textsuperscript{2}E-to-fuzzer and fuzzer-to-S\textsuperscript{2}E PoV exchange
      \item allowed to discover 30\% more bugs in the same time frame
    \end{itemize}
  Automated proof of vulnerability generation with the S\textsuperscript{2}E symbolic execution engine:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item allowed seamless PoV generation for every bug discovered in the binary
      \item introduced no overhead to the execution process
      \item successfully used in a CTF security competition
    \end{itemize}
  Developed a memory bugs detection technique based on S\textsuperscript{2}E symbolic execution engine:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item utilizes novel metadata propagation approach
      \item allows dynamic detection of memory violations
      \item gives zero false positives with a real world applications
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2012--2014}{Software engineer}{LLC "WISE-Technique"}{Zhukovskij, Russia}{}
{
  Developed a microkernel real time operating system with ARINC 653 and POSIX(partial) layers.
  Following features were implemented from scratch:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item OS kernel
      \item multi-arch and multi-core support for PowerPC and IA-32
      \item drivers for PCI, SATA, Ethernet
      \item debugging environment (based on KVM and GDB)
    \end{itemize}
  Developed kernel drivers and user space software for the helicopter flight recorder:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item implemented an ARINC653 API layer for the common kernel drivers
      \item deployed RTOS on cutomer's embedded hardware system
    \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{2012--2012}{Software engineer}{FSUE "Flight Research Center"}{Zhukovskij, Russia}{}
{
  Migrated 3D rendering engine from X11 to Wayland.
  Also enhanced performance by reimplementing functions using SIMD instructions.
}

\cventry{2008--2012}{Software engineer}{JSC "V.V. Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design"}{Zhukovskij, Russia}{}
{
  Developed software for civil sonar data acquisition and analysis.
  Full software stack starting from FPGA firmware and up to GUI applications was implemented:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item FPGA firmware for signal synthesis and digitizing
    \item FPGA device driver for Linux
    \item user space cross-platform software for sonar control and data processing
    \item real time data acquisition, processing and layout
  \end{itemize}
}
